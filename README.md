# Coding standards

## Purpose of this document

This document outlines coding standards and conventions that are recommended for client side development. Coding to a standard is not a barrier to innovation, it is a living document that should be updated by new concepts and implementation patterns. Through maintaining standards in development we support better understandability and maintainability of our code.

## General

### Indentation

Space characters should be used to indent code, tab characters should be avoided. Soft tabs are available in most development environments, soft tabs act like hard tabs but resolves to spaces. Default indentation is 4 spaces.

### Line length

Dynamic word wrapping and high resolution displays makes fixed line length for content obsolete. However in programming arbitrary wrapping can make code difficult to understand. Manual line breaks are preferred for code. 

In typography, the measure is a reference to the width of a column of text. The measure has an ideal range of 45 to 75 characters per line for optimal legibility. 

A default line length of 80 characters is recommend.

### !important

The !important rule when applied to a CSS property will override the property value applied through the cascade. Overriding the cascade significantly increases the effort in maintaining the code.

The !important rule must be avoided.

### Internet Explorer conditional comments

### Internet Explorer compatibility mode

Internet Explorer can render as if it were a previous version without explicit instruction from the browser user. To prevent this, we inform the browser that the latest render engine version for the particular browser should be used.
